Dreams are a strange thing. We spend all night dreaming and often they’re forgotten when we wake. Dreams can be nightmares, pleasures, and complete nonsense. You could spend your life trying to understand the world of dreams.

But beyond understanding, dreams can feel like a connection to another world. Sometimes we’re aware that we’re dreaming, a lucid state of clarity. Other times sleep paralysis brings a lack of control and half-awake phantoms. It makes you question if your dreams followed you home.

This was fertile ground for the mind of H. P. Lovecraft. His Dream Cycle series focuses on the Dreamlands. The story's characters enter the bizarre yet familiar alternate dimension through their dreams. Human-like creatures prowl at night and familiar animals are twisted with monstrous traits. Many describe Lovecraft's works as dream-like, perhaps if only to remove us from the uncomfortable madness.

This dream world provides a major theme that inspires Sorcery: Contested Realm. Perceptive players may find power in dreams, terrible rituals, and direct Lovecraft references.

The Dream-Quest is our gateway to this exploration. In The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath, sleep is used to enter the Dreamlands to find Kadath. It's no coincidence that the Dream-Quest card puts a spellcaster to sleep to find a chosen card. It’s all there: the name, the exploration of dreams, and the acquisition of knowledge.

Exploring the Dreamlands, Carter runs into the Men of Leng. These bizarre creatures have wide mouths, dwarfish tails, hooves, small horns, and fur. Sorcery would depict these as "discordant beasts" with the same characteristics.

In the Library of Leng you may find the Pnakotic Manuscripts. These prehistoric texts contain vast knowledge beyond human understanding. In Sorcery, this “document of transmundane madness” gives you a card at the cost of damage. It's a classic contract with the devil: knowledge and power for a piece of you.

The Pnakotic Manuscripts card reflects Lovecraftian madness. That is, receiving new knowledge in a traumatic event that recontextualizes a worldview. In the game, Receiving new cards in exchange for damage reconfigures a hand and gameplan. It’s a great fit on many levels.

Finally, the Dreamlands themselves find representation in Sorcery. Sapient beings create the Dreamlands, changing as their perception changes. As players of Sorcery and our Avatars, we alter the Void to create sites with our will.

The connection between Sorcery and Lovecraft’s works seems clear. Can you find the other references in the game? Be careful, it might drive you a little mad.

In 1993, Magic: The Gathering was still coloured cardstock and a photocopier. The creators accepted Drew Tucker's submission to work on the game. At the time he was following his dreams at the Cornish college of arts in Seattle. It was an exciting oppourtunity to work on his first real assignment.

This choice was a no-brainer for Drew. While at first he studied Graphic Design at university, he would follow his passion for art. Now he could build on his favourite childhood art subjects: “werewolves and monsters, cemeteries, ghosts, and blood”. Dreams are a strange thing.

But Magic had no style guide at the time, only card names. There was no established fantasy world, only abstract ideas and trends. Before modern Magic’s art rules, Drew had artistic freedom. He would develop his signature style: ethereal impressions with watercolours.

From Power Leak to Gibbering Barricade, you can tell apart a Drew Tucker card. I would use the words soft, ethereal, abstract, and impressionist to explain his style. He would play with painting from an emotional state. This process was trying to feel something and imparting that on the viewer. It didn’t always work out (see: Night Soil) but it was always unique and decidedly Drew.

Comparing his old and new work, there’s obvious improvement. He was fresh out of school for that first assignment. He’s since learned a lot about different mediums and visual art fundamentals. The newer stuff can take a less abstract form but keeps that stylized and exaggerated style.

Drew’s work tends to leave a lasting impression. Have you seen his other works? What emotion did they leave you with?

Some time around 2022, Sorcery contacted Drew to draw card art. He was an early consideration and the third artist to be commissioned. I think that the Men of Leng card would be the synthesis of Drew’s emotional art and Sorcery’s cosmic horror connections.

The dynamic viewpoints raise the tension. Viewed from the ground, the small beasts seem imposing. What might have felt as worrying as wild animals is more dangerous as they kneel down and loom over you. It feels as if they are deciding your fate.

The disjointed anatomy also brings a sense of the uncanny. By understanding the rules of anatomy, you can break them. Drew uses this to create forms that our base instincts find wrong or unnatural. He utilizes this otherworldly depiction to heighten that feeling of unease.

Finally, the game mechanics bring it all together in a cohesive package. When the Men of Leng attack your Avatar, you discard a random card. Bit by bit these dream creatures gnaw at your mind, seizing your memories piece by piece. Then you’re reduced to a shadow of your former self, lost and powerless in the Void.

Sorcery would pay wonderful homage to their influences with a mixture of art and game design. Yet none of the other artists weaving cosmic horror into Sorcery would strike me quite like the Men of Leng. I find it difficult to describe but familiar, like a dream half-forgotten in the morning.
